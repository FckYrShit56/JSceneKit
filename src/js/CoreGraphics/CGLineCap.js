 * @property {number} butt - A line with a squared-off end. Core Graphics draws the line to extend only to the exact endpoint of the path. This is the default.
 * @property {number} round - A line with a rounded end. Core Graphics draws the line to extend beyond the endpoint of the path. The line ends with a semicircular arc with a radius of 1/2 the lineâ€™s width, centered on the endpoint.
 * @property {number} square - A line with a squared-off end. Core Graphics extends the line beyond the endpoint of the path for a distance equal to half the line width.
